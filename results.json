As an opportunistic vehicle, EOF has the flexibility to make both private and public investments across the capital structure.  However, the majority of its portfolio today is comprised of control private equity investments.  The realization period for both of EOF\u2019s active funds began in 2020 and is expected to last between 4-6 years.  The team is currently focused on adding value to its existing investments through the execution of operational improvements, refinancing transactions, strategic partnerships, bolt-on acquisitions, and divestitures.\nThe EOF team remains confident in its long-term thesis that a systematic pullback of capital from the oil and gas industry following a decade-long boom driven by investor optimism, abundance of credit, and regulatory flaws will cause high-quality, low-decline production outside of the historically hot shale plays to become more sought after. We believe that our emphasis on assets with existing cash flow and production and our proactive approach to managing liquidity will allow us to endure the current distress cycle and ultimately maximize value for our investors over the realization periods of our funds.\nAbout AllianceBernstein\nWe are a leading global investment management firm offering high-quality research and diversified investment services to institutional clients, individuals and private clients in major markets around the globe. With over 3,700 employees across 51 locations operating in 25 countries, our ambition is simple: to be the most trusted investment firm in the world.
