Energy Opportunity Fund Overview
AllianceBernstein’s Energy Opportunity Fund (“EOF”) was founded in 2015.  Part of AB’s Alternatives platform, EOF makes and manages investments in small and mid-sized oil and gas producers in North America across two funds with approximately $630 million of aggregate committed capital.  As an opportunistic vehicle, EOF has the flexibility to make both private and public investments across the capital structure.  However, the majority of its portfolio today is comprised of control private equity investments.  The realization period for both of EOF’s active funds began in 2020 and is expected to last between 4-6 years.  The team is currently focused on adding value to its existing investments through the execution of operational improvements, refinancing transactions, strategic partnerships, bolt-on acquisitions, and divestitures.
The EOF team remains confident in its long-term thesis that a systematic pullback of capital from the oil and gas industry following a decade-long boom driven by investor optimism, abundance of credit, and regulatory flaws will cause high-quality, low-decline production outside of the historically hot shale plays to become more sought after. We believe that our emphasis on assets with existing cash flow and production and our proactive approach to managing liquidity will allow us to endure the current distress cycle and ultimately maximize value for our investors over the realization periods of our funds.

    <job_description>BERNSTEIN PRIVATE WEALTH MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW:
In a world where most investment managers look alike, Bernstein Private Wealth Management has evolved into an organization like no other. We have the resources of the largest global firms, but the service culture of a boutique. AB ranks among the leading investment management firms in the world with over $600 billion in assets under management. And, while many firms can point to a comparable worldwide footprint, few can lay claim to 50 years of serving private clients. Our resources are vast, but our relationships are personal, and we aspire to make every client feel like they are our only client.
Bernstein Private Wealth Management’s clients are located around the globe. Bernstein has offices in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, Minneapolis, Nashville, New York, Philadelphia, San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle, Tampa, Washington, D.C., and West Palm Beach. Bernstein Private Wealth Management reported $99 billion in assets under management as of August 31, 2020. For more information, please visit http://www.Bernstein.com.
RESPONSIBILITIES:
The Financial Advisor (“Advisor” or “FA”) is a critical member of the Bernstein Private Wealth Management Team. The principal role of the advisor is to develop new clients by cultivating their personal and professional networks and leveraging relationships with centers of influence. Advisors are also responsible for maintaining close, ongoing relationships with their existing clients.
Bernstein’s Advisors work closely with clients who have the benefit of substantial assets, but the burden of significant complexity.

The business has entrusted the ACE team to help solve their business challenges. The Programmer / Analyst will contribute to the best approach and solution, as well as work on projects that directly impact the business’ ability to support new financial products. If you are looking for an opportunity to be a trusted and respected technical advisor, this may be a perfect fit for you.
THE TEAM
The ACE (Automated Cashflow Entry) team is responsible for enhancing and supporting the ACE application accessed by 1500+ global users, 24 hours a day, six days a week. ACE exclusively manages all cash movements, controls asset movements, Corporate Actions processing, currency purchases, and account opening/maintenance at AB. We are a team within the Business Process Innovation department.
The team works directly with the business on developing processes to address their issues. The development process evolves with an understanding of business needs, proven through iterations, which reveals the ideal solution and best approach to accomplish the business’ task.
THE ROLE
The Programmer Analyst will work closely with Application architects to deliver new solutions within the existing ACE application framework, consolidate and upgrade existing functions, and provide production support to a large user population.
The ACE application is a moderately high volume, transactional system that processes roughly 80 different workflows and transaction types. ACE transactions vary in function from simply moving information to be refined by different departments, to moving, posting or trading, either securities or cash. A successful candidate will be risk-aware, business focused, cool-headed, and technically proficient.
In working with business partners, the candidate’s coding fluency will be a success factor in this partnership as the code is adapted as the solution evolves. The candidate will be highly involved in the process and once trained, will be expected to listen, learn and contribute on the best approach to accomplish the business’ task.
